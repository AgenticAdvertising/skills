description: "Brand sentiment analysis targeted at a COMPETITOR brand — scans Reddit, X, and G2 for complaints, switcher signals, feature gaps, price backlash, and comparisons, then translates each into a competitive paid‑ads move (wedge hooks, switcher creative, audience targeting, messaging angles)."

  version: 1.0.0

## 1. Purpose

The inverse of [social-listening](social-listening.md): that skill watches what the market says about **your** brand so you can fix your ads. This one watches what the market says about a **competitor** so you can **attack** theirs.

Every complaint, switcher, feature gap, or price gripe aired publicly is a wedge you can lift directly into a creative — in their own customers' language — and target at people shaped like them.

Run **weekly**, or on demand before briefing a competitor‑targeted campaign.

Every run answers two questions:

1. **"What's cracking in the target brand's audience right now?"**
2. **"What should my ads *say* and *who* should they *target* because of it?"**

## 2. Inputs

- **Target brand** — the competitor being listened to (required; **one brand per run**).
- **Subreddits, X handles, G2 page** scoped to the target.
- **Your positioning** (from the platform's BrandKit) — so insights are filtered to wedges *you can credibly defend*, not every complaint uniformly.

## 3. Sources & What to Pull

Same three surfaces as `social-listening`, but every query is scoped to the **target competitor**, not your brand.

| Source     | Pull                                                                                                                   | Competitive value                                                                             |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reddit** | Threads mentioning target · *"alternatives to [target]"* posts · 1‑star experiences · complaint threads in key subs    | Switcher threads and complaint posts — often the most candid wedge material.                  |
| **X**      | Target handle mentions · negative replies · *"just switched off [target]"* posts                                       | Speed — catches viral roasts, PR moments, founder gaffes.                                     |
| **G2**     | 1–3 star reviews for target · *"What do you dislike?"* sections · *"Why did you switch?"* answers                      | Structured feature gaps and switcher reasoning — by role and company size.                    |

**Minimum viable run:** ≥ **30 target‑relevant mentions** combined. Under threshold → output *"Insufficient data — broaden subreddit list or re‑run in 14 days."*

## 4. Signal Classification

Each mention gets one label (competitive lens, not your‑brand lens):

| Label                           | Definition                                                              |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 😤 **Complaint**                | Explicit frustration with target — friction, bugs, support, onboarding  |
| 🚪 **Switcher**                 | Someone leaving the target for an alternative (you or otherwise)        |
| 🕳 **Gap**                      | Feature/outcome the target doesn't deliver (wish list, feature request) |
| 💸 **Price**                    | Cost complaints — *"too expensive"*, *"not worth it"*, bill shock       |
| 🏆 **Praise (narrow)**          | Specific win for the target — flags what **not** to attack              |
| 🆚 **vs. You / alternatives**   | Target compared to you or another alternative                           |

## 5. Theme Clustering

Group mentions into themes (≥ **3 mentions** = reportable). Per theme:

- **Cluster label** — short phrase (*"setup takes forever"*, *"reporting is too shallow"*)
- **Mix** — % complaint / switcher / gap / price / praise
- **Verbatim quotes** — 3, one per source when possible — this is your hook fodder
- **Volume trend** vs. prior period (↑ / ↓ / flat)
- **Audience signal** — who's complaining (role, company size, industry if inferable from the post/review)

## 6. Competitive Paid‑Ads Insight Logic

Each pattern maps to a specific competitive move:

| Theme pattern                                                    | Competitive move                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **High‑volume Complaint on a specific friction**                 | **Wedge hook** — lift the complaint **verbatim** (*"Still waiting 40s for [Target]'s dashboard?"*). Audience: `Interest: [Target]`.                            |
| **Recurring Switcher pattern** (*"left X because Y"*)            | **Switcher creative** — quote the exit reason. CTA: *"Make the switch."* Audience: lookalike of users engaging with your versus ads.                          |
| **Gap cluster** (repeated feature requests)                      | **"Finally, X can Y"** positioning — attack the gap. Brief via [creative-brief](creative-brief.md) pairing Gap + Direct Problem angles.                       |
| **Price backlash**                                               | **Value/price creative** — contrast pricing or bundle. Only run if your pricing is *actually* competitive — don't bluff.                                       |
| **Narrow Praise**                                                | **Defensive intel** — do *not* attack on this wedge; pivot to complaint/gap themes instead.                                                                   |
| **Comparisons that favor you**                                   | Lean in — the market is already saying it. Quote market language verbatim in the ad (beats brand‑written copy).                                               |
| **Comparisons that favor a third alternative**                   | Watch closely — a rival is eating the wedge you wanted. Escalate to positioning.                                                                              |
| **Complaint sentiment spike ≥ +10pp WoW**                        | 🚀 **Budget moment** — scale competitor‑targeted ads for 7–14 days while the narrative is hot.                                                                |
