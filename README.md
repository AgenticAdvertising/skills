# Ad Ops Skills

Practical AI‑agent skills for running paid ad accounts — diagnostics, monitoring, and creative generation for Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and other channels.

Built for media buyers and agencies who want an AI assistant that can answer *"how are my accounts doing?"* and *"what should I do about it?"* without rebuilding the logic from scratch. Compatible with Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK, and any agent runtime that supports Agent Skills.

## Format

Each skill is a single markdown file with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `metadata.version`) and numbered sections covering detection logic, thresholds, action workflow, and a concrete example output. Skills are self‑contained — no shared context file is required.

## Usage

All these skills are directly available in Adside.ai within the Skills section under Settings:
