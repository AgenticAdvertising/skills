## Format

Each skill is a single markdown file with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `metadata.version`) and numbered sections covering detection logic, thresholds, action workflow, and a concrete example output. Skills are self‑contained — no shared context file is required.

## Usage

All these skills are directly available in Adside.ai within the Skills section under Settings:

Then you can invoke them with the /command in the Chat:
